pair_style rdip command :h3

[Syntax:]

pair_style rdip cutoff :pre

cutoff = global cutoff (distance units) :ul

[Examples:]

pair_style rdip 15.0
pair_coeff * * C.rdip C C EDGE :pre

pair_style hybrid/overlay airebo 3.0 0 1 rdip 15.0
pair_coeff * * airebo CH.airebo C C C H
pair_coeff * * rdip   C.rdip C C NULL NULL :pre

[Description:]

The {rdip} pair style computes a Registry Dependent Interlayer Potential (RDIP)
as described by Kolmogorov and Crespi in "(KC05)"_#KC05.

The potential is of the form:

:c,image(Eqs/pair_rdip.jpg)

The nearest-neighbors searched for the calculation of the normal
have to be of the same atom type, or one that is mapped as EDGE.
This pair_style supports surface atoms with three or more neighbors.

One can use only a single pair_coeff command which specifies a RDIP potential
file and the mapping of LAMMPS to RDIP atom types.

For example, given a graphene flake on a pristine graphene surface:

pair_coeff * * C.rdip C C EDGE :pre

The 1st and 2nd argument must be * * so as to span all LAMMPS atom types.
The 3rd argument is the name of the potential file that has to include
all requested RDIP atom types.
The following N arguments assign one of the RDIP types included in the parameter
file to the LAMMPS atom types.
The atoms in each layer have to be of a distinct LAMMPS atom type.
In this example, the first atom type would be the carbon atoms of the pristine
graphene, while the second atom type would be the carbon atoms of the adsorbed
flake.
Two special atom types are implemented:
If an atom type is mapped to EDGE, this type will be considered for being
a nearest neighbor in the definition of the surface normals
(e.g. the H atoms saturating the flake).
If an atom type is mapped as NULL, this type won't be evaluated at all.
This can be used when the {rdip} potential is used as part of the {hybrid} pair style.

The parameters defined in the included C.rdip file are taken from the original
publication "(KC05)"_#KC05.

[Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info]:

This pair style does not support the "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html
mix, shift, table, and tail options.

This pair style writes its information to "binary restart files"_restart.html,
so pair_style and pair_coeff commands do not need to be specified in an input
script that reads a restart file.

This pair style can only be used via the {pair} keyword of the
"run_style respa"_run_style.html command. The {inner}, {middle} and
{outer} keywords are not supported.

[Restrictions:]

This fix is part of the USER-MISC package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info.

This pair potential requires the "newton"_newton.html setting to be "on" for
pair interactions.

The C.rdip potential file provided with LAMMPS (see the potentials directory)
is parameterized for metal "units"_units.html.

[Default:] none
