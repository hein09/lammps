This package implements the "fix pw" and "fix cp" commands which can
be used in a LAMMPS input script.

These fixes couple the Quantum-Espresso package to LAMMPS and allow
for DFT calculations to be performed in the context of a LAMMPS simulation.

This package was written by Sebastian Gs√§nger at FAU (sebastian.gsaenger at fau.de).
