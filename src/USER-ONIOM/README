This package implements the "fix oniom" command which can be used
in a LAMMPS input script.

This fix enables LAMMPS to be used in a ONIOM-Style QM/MM simulation.

This is adopted by Sebastian Gs√§nger at FAU (sebastian.gsaenger at fau.de)
from the original "fix qmmm" by Axel Kohlmeyer at Temple U (akohlmey at gmail.com).
