This package implements the "fix oniom" command which can be used
in a LAMMPS input script.

This fix enables LAMMPS to be used in a QM/MM simulation, currently
only in combination with pw.x code from the Quantum ESPRESSO package.

This is created by Sebastian Gs√§nger at FAU (sebastian.gsaenger@fau.de)
based on the QM/MM implementation by Axel Kohlmeyer (akohlmey at gmail.com).
