This package implements multiple commands which can be used to perform ONIOM calculations.

The "oniom" command wraps the "run" and "minimization" commands and enables exchanging of positions and forces
between multiple partitions according to the ONIOM-scheme.

The "fix qe/pw" and "fix qe/cp" commands can be used to offload calculation to the respective program of the
QuantumEspresso suite and perform BOMD or CPMD, respectively.

This package was written by Sebastian Gs√§nger at FAU (sebastian.gsaenger at fau.de).
